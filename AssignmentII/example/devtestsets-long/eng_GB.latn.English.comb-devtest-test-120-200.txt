eng	High unemployment among young people is one of the Commission's top priorities and is one of my foremost personal concerns.
eng	How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are seeing us closing our countries' borders? Is it possible to talk about that? We

eng	However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal: safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause.
eng	However, and this concerns Mr Stavrakakis, there is also a need for improved cooperation with the other funds in this area and, in particular, the fund for rural development.
eng	However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment
eng	However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU, expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity

eng	I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth.

eng	I am voting for this report because it includes a range of concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), by acknowledging
eng	the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) and the need to include additional indicators to measure economic and social progress in the medium and long terms. I would also draw attention to the
eng	establishment of clear and measurable indicators that take into account climate change, biodiversity, efficient resource utilisation and social inclusion, which could help lead to a more inclusive
eng	I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final resolution includes a clear call for full effective investigation into the European Union Member States' complicity and their renditions and
eng	I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies.
eng	I endorsed adoption of the directive. I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise, is more
eng	I fully support Ms Pack's initiative and I want to ask Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include Sarajevo as a European cultural capital. I believe that, if we all want this, it
eng	absolutely can be possible, because it would be very disappointing if our ideas and common sense were to be blocked by bureaucracy.
eng	I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument, which means no
eng	harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a Europe-wide system. I have also seen the support for an instrument applicable in both B2C and B2B transactions, which favours a
eng	material scope covering sales contracts, contracts for the supply of digital content and some service contracts. I have taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament, namely, that any
eng	future instrument, whatever it looks like, should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under national law.
eng	I hope that this kind of problem, whereby the Council discharge has been postponed by Parliament, will never come up in the future again so I ask that even during the Hungarian Presidency we should
eng	I particularly welcome the call for at least 70% of budget funding to be spent on territorial cooperation in cross-border collaboration, on the one hand, and for the funding for territorial

eng	I should like to express my pride at the European Parliament's broadly favourable view in support of the appointment of the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi.
eng	I support the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities because I believe that it
eng	I supported today's report calling for a joint register of lobbyists and interest groups to be set up. This is a first step towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and
eng	Commission. A 'transparency register' will improve ease of access for citizens wishing to find specific information regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with both MEPs and
eng	I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which represents a major step forward in consumer protection. I also welcome the option taken by the Council of restricting this directive to
eng	door-to-door and Internet sales - a market that is expanding significantly, but in which consumers still feel a little lost - and I approve of the simplification measures adopted, not least the
eng	I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of credit rating agencies as the standards may vary, and necessarily so, between Member States.
eng	I voted for the report because the transmission of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes constitutes a particular threat to people, through the intake of said bacteria and/or through daily contact
eng	with animals. I believe that commitment to research is essential, as it contributes to the development of antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against diseases afflicting both people and
eng	I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and creative industries should constitute an added value for the Union. A European statute for artists based on favourable working
eng	conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work, making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals.
eng	I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework. I should particularly like to emphasise the call
eng	contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments between
eng	Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers. I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the
eng	budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also, so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks.
eng	I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) because,
eng	as the report states, its accounts and transactions, taken as a whole, are shown in the analysis to be positive, regular and legal.
eng	I voted in favour of the alternative motion for a resolution on corporate governance in financial institutions as it tables proposals which would ensure improvements in corporate governance
eng	structures throughout the EU, taking into account the fact that the financial sector must respond to the needs of the real economy, contribute to sustainable growth and demonstrate greater social
eng	I voted in favour of the report on the Protocol extending to customs security measures the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and the Principality
eng	of Andorra, since it encourages trade between both parties while ensuring a high level of customs security and consistency between the agreement and the EU acquis.
eng	I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and the repeal of
eng	I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in lifelong learning
eng	I voted in favour of this report, but I think we should have been clearer and stronger in our demands when it comes to the mechanism of sanctions and penalties.
eng	I voted to give discharge to Frontex, but observe that the Court of Auditors reported, for the second year running, that the agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed
eng	by the agency, while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument. I note that the amount paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009, and was EUR 17 000 000 in 2008. I welcome,
eng	nevertheless, the agency's initiative, made in response to the Court's observation, of signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State border authorities.
eng	I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level
eng	I welcome the Council's annual report and the efforts made to develop a European foreign policy. I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position which is harmonious with the Member States'
eng	foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level.
eng	I welcome the fact that Parliament is particularly pressing for agreements concluded by the European Union to include mutual recognition of aviation security and safety standards, as well as better
eng	I welcomed this document because this report is a response to the Commission's Communication on the mid-term review of the autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Galileo and
eng	EGNOS), which assesses the process and implementation so far and launches the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing.
eng	I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and
eng	not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently. I would also like to call for a simplification of the
eng	process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union.
eng	I would like to urge the Commission to speed up the gathering of research from all Member States, but also to support new research into antibiotics that would be effective for humans and would save

eng	If the supply of energy resources is not exploited as a political tool, if it applies equal, transparent and non-discriminatory rules to all market players, if Russia makes an objective choice to

eng	If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to
eng	achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to
eng	carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our
eng	countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
eng	If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels.
eng	If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally end, because it is only this language which Lukashenko understands.

eng	In 2013, 800 MHz will be freed up, in 2015, 1 200 MHz, and that is badly needed if Europe wants to remain amongst the global frontrunners.
eng	In North Africa and the Arab world, that destination will not be reached quickly or without setbacks, but building deep democracy is the only way that destination will be reached at all.
eng	In a speech on 7 April of this year, your colleague, Commissioner Potočnik, announced that, despite the Commission having avoided this issue and done nothing for many years, he intended presenting a
eng	communication in the autumn of this year in which he would tackle the problem, in particular with regard to implementation of existing regulations and an improved inspection system, as well as a

eng	In anticipation of the White Paper, the legislation now envisaged requires the Member States and the Commission to take the next steps towards a more sustainable and interoperational transport
eng	In conclusion, therefore, I believe it is necessary that the 2012 budget is able to respond to the challenges Europe is facing in a more concrete manner.
eng	In fact, the ability to recreate something offered to us and, on that basis, give rise to something new, is fundamental to the development of any economy and, above all, to achieving social welfare.
eng	In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU and India, the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to which the
eng	text identified and dealt with the key areas which the Commissioner specifically mentioned, such as government procurement, services, investment in trade facilitation, etc.
eng	In my country's constitution, there is no mention of this issue, and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution? Moreover, it is rather strange because, in

eng	In my view, there will be no multiannual budgets from 2014 onward so long as those declarations from Member States are not given.
eng	In order to avoid red tape and facilitate companies' access to European funding, simpler and more transparent procedures are absolutely vital.
eng	In order to prevent this crisis becoming any worse, therefore, we need to take action regarding the fisheries sector's problems; swift and far-reaching action.
eng	In other words, with these problems of a railway alternative, the truth is that the agreement on the Eurovignette is now imposing even greater burdens on the transportation of products by road,
eng	which, in the peripheral countries, particularly in the south and in the east, are products of little or limited added value.

eng	In the communication, the Commission suggests various new initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be taken.
eng	In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he meets and
eng	whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact us using many other different communication channels.
eng	In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the Commission.
eng	In the plenary sitting of 6 April 2011, the President announced, in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, that he had received a letter from the National
eng	Anti-Corruption Department (Prosecutor's Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of Romania) on 5 April 2011 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Adrian Severin.
eng	In the wake of the financial crisis and the ongoing need to reduce budget deficits across Europe, Parliament must recognise that the cohesion budget cannot continue to grow, unchecked.
eng	In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles, such as
eng	In this regard, I confirm that I have authorised my staff to continue down our chosen path, because the Commission has always supported origin labelling both for products made in the European Union

eng	In view of the above, such a system cannot be successfully introduced without penalties, and without restrictive penalties, as some have said.
eng	In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles on how air agreements should be

eng	It is a guarantee of support for the least-developed regions and disadvantaged groups, leading to balanced social and territorial development in the Union, and a course of action that has great
eng	significance for the 27 Member States, which are required to lay down strategic territorial development guidelines through the increasingly active involvement of the social partners.
eng	It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member States manage themselves, so that we may send them warning signals in time. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament followed
eng	this practice with close attention; in this European semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter budgetary management, and, at the same time, we lay down the basis for the practice

eng	It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general.
eng	It is not only important for children, for the very young children I have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for the future of
eng	Europe. I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts, because
eng	It is obvious that today in Europe, even the biggest Member States do not have the necessary influence or leverage to talk on an equal basis with the United States or China and other powers, but
eng	It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU itself, to

eng	It is therefore obvious that President Assad and his whole family need to be included on the list - not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but today.

eng	report (for Eurobonds). A choice of votes that is intended to reflect my very mixed feelings over this package, which admittedly does offer some steps forward but which is still too poorly balanced:
eng	Europe will be unable to continue to develop without its people and therefore we must debate solutions for the future in public.
eng	It was also clear during the mission that we made to Bulgaria and Romania, and for this I would like to thank my fellow Romanian Members, Mr Marinescu, Mr Enciu and Mrs Weber, and my fellow Bulgarian
eng	It will be a way for us to be able genuinely to exchange best practices. I believe that in the long term, this will constitute one firm basis for economic growth in Europe, but more important than
eng	economic growth is to remember that it is via this process that people, young people, can grow as individuals and Europeans.
eng	It would be appropriate that, in areas of exclusive competence, the EU should be the pre-eminent actor, with full membership, while the Member States might also - but not necessarily - be present as

eng	Ladies and gentlemen, the current trends pose a threat to the future of the EU and to the prosperity and well-being of Europeans.
eng	Last year, 2010, we reviewed the existing situation of volunteering, through bilateral meetings, surveys and a dedicated conference in September 2010.
eng	Lastly, for the future, we propose in this report to double the amount of research funding in order to create this European research area, with the help of the European Research Council.
eng	Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible.
eng	Let me make it clear: a right-thinking Member State such as the Netherlands will never be able to agree with this report. MEPs with a fresh, freedom-loving vision should throw this report straight in

eng	Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has become one of the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted within the European Union.
eng	Madam President, when the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into office, there were major question marks against the relevance and effectiveness of the IMF.
eng	Many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan, such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers.
eng	Measures such as a European patent and the European professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment.
eng	Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation, reduced from three years to one year: Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges
eng	More recent analysis conducted in 2010 shows that the costs of meeting the 20% greenhouse gas reduction target have fallen by at least one third compared to the analysis made in 2008.
eng	Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public
eng	procurement outside the Union, in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts.
eng	Moreover, the results achieved will convince the whole of Europe that it has successfully enhanced the security of the entire Union.

eng	provide information on the content of the IAS's four 'very important' recommendations and the action taken by the Agency.
eng	Nevertheless, we must make every effort to ensure that these policies promote the values and interests of the EU at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to
eng	solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions,

eng	No, this is a proposal that the European Commission has made with respect to the massive flooding in Pakistan, time-bound for two years, with the possibility of its being continued for another year.
eng	Now is perhaps the time, he said, for Plan B - something, I hasten to add, that the Committee on International Trade has been looking for for a long time.
eng	Now, in these turbulent times, a new competent Managing Director must therefore be appointed for an important global institution such as this and the process must be open.

eng	The payments should include as few exemptions as possible, and should apply to the so-called external costs of road transport, including noise and, above all, emissions. I am frankly curious as to
eng	how the individual states will justify their unwillingness to introduce payments, at least under Table 1, which is a very watered-down version of what genuine environmentalists want.
eng	The positives are that transaction costs are low, that partner countries have an increased responsibility for themselves and that there is a better dialogue between partners and donors.
eng	The principal goal of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative is to promote youth mobility and to break down barriers that are still standing in its way.
eng	The process must be evidence-based, impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement, and on that basis, as I have said, the time for talking is over and we need to move forward.
eng	The proposal is based on the Euratom Treaty and, in particular, on the guidelines provided in the report 'Assessing Euratom - 50 years of European nuclear energy policy'. The rapporteur identifies
eng	The proposed strengthening of the European Defence Agency would not mean a genuine increase in the level of security in the EU, but merely the creation of another bureaucratic monster, incapable of
eng	performing the tasks assigned to it. Who would take the decision to mobilise European armed forces? Whose interests would their units be acting in? How much of a say would the new Member States have?
eng	Would the EDA's headquarters be relocated? Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters, such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member
eng	States' armies, and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service.
eng	The qualities that these frequencies possess in terms of coverage and penetration of buildings are universally recognised: they are called golden frequencies.
eng	The reality is that this proposal will have a disproportionate impact upon the peripheral Member States in the European Union, such as Ireland, as centrally located Member States have the option of
eng	The report also fails to mention the withdrawal of sovereign debt from the agencies' ratings, which is the main measure that could be taken in this area to combat speculation against the euro.
eng	The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective
eng	bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the abolition of child labour.
eng	The report is divided into five parts: security and foreign policy, security and defence, external and internal security, security through operations and security in partnership.
eng	The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive.
eng	The request to increase the post-2013 EU budget by 5%, and therefore to increase the total European Union GNI from 1.06% to 1.11%, corresponds to a desire to honour commitments made to support growth
eng	The restoration of the rule of law in Madagascar is an absolute priority and requires the organisation of free, transparent and democratic elections supported by international aid and, first and

eng	The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self-interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe's moral and political failure.
eng	The severely exploitative and discriminatory conditions under which many of those engaged in domestic work operate are well known.
eng	The sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the bank crisis is solved - and the bank crisis will not be solved until markets are confident in providing capital and liquidity to banks.
eng	The substantive difference lies in the fact that this report makes no reference to the origin marking to be included on textile product labels.
eng	The time has also come for the EU to use effective and creative measures to implement the aims set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, such as reducing the school drop-out rate to under 10% and ensuring
eng	The two principles that define Europe are solidarity - we stand by this - and a sense of individual responsibility - that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take
eng	The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less

eng	Their conservation represents an important contribution to the welfare of populations, as well as contributing to job creation in rural areas.
eng	There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective forms of aid, aimed at re-establishing the affected areas and improving the living conditions of the affected people; based on a policy of
eng	effective and lasting development cooperation and aid, which supports the integrated and sustainable development of local communities.
eng	There is a large and growing resident population of foreign hauliers using foreign vehicles and paying only their own countries' modest vehicle charges who are taking more and more domestic business.
eng	There is also a need for enhanced market access, including the modernisation of the standardisation system within the EU, and for better access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public

eng	Therefore, our resolution calls urgently on all EU institutions and on the Member States to do everything possible to prevent Mr al-Nashiri from being executed.

eng	This is a balanced approach, as the opinion recognises the progress made by these two countries in terms of the criteria which must be satisfied for integration into the Schengen area (control of
eng	land, sea and air borders, visas, police cooperation, readiness in terms of connecting to and using the Schengen Information System and data protection), but also requires regular progress reports on
eng	This is also reinforced, however, by an attempt to legitimise the system of sanctions, with an attempt to include a system of incentives.
eng	This is because, in my opinion, the EU should refrain from imposing social prerogatives on third countries, however correct or beneficial they may deem them to be. Whilst I accept the importance of
eng	fostering humane methods of treating a workforce, social policy in the EU has already wreaked havoc on a number of UK institutions and should not be extended. A degree of flexibility and freedom is
eng	needed when dealing with social policy, as one-size-fits-all policy making can be counterproductive when applied at domestic level.

eng	This is part of the campaign consisting of promotion material showing a foetus with the words 'Let me live', with the Commission's logo. I made it very clear: this campaign is not in line with the

eng	This is why I supported Mrs Niebler's report on the necessary changes to impact assessments, particularly regarding the introduction of an independent mechanism.
eng	This is why we also need to look at the European budget as part of one system: both for economic governance and for managing the single currency.
eng	This means that, in many situations, GDP can increase while the majority of a country's citizens become poorer, because GDP does not take into consideration the level of inequality in a society.
eng	This new directive, which comprises the fusion of four already existing directives, aims to give new impetus to completing the internal market by removing legal obstacles to cross-border trade.

eng	This report contains several proposals to achieve this: the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries, for example, to coordinate cultural relations and interaction
eng	between the EU and those countries, or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service (EEAS) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit

eng	To begin with, I consider it essential that this new instrument continue to prioritise achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to achieve this aim - specifically, the eradication
eng	To that end, the EU must make the necessary resources available to both countries to support social services such as education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building,

eng	Today in the European Parliament, we voted on the Coelho report on the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania.
eng	Today, Parliament adopted the amended text of the Consumer Rights Directive of my fellow Member, Mr Schwab. I welcome the adoption of this directive which will contribute to strengthening the

eng	We also call for more money, to clear our conscience, but there is a lot of Arab money which is not invested in Arab democracy and Arab prosperity.

eng	We are, of course, open to more efficient use and better implementation. I agree that mistakes, arrests of innocent people, etc., should be avoided.
eng	We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation.
eng	We can note a marked improvement in the situation of SMEs, but progress still needs to be made. SMEs continue to come up against considerable problems in expanding their activities, and sometimes
eng	We could speak of cultural management or about giving a new impetus to the one-time idea of Melina Mercouri for a European Capital of Culture.

eng	We must also help our manufacturers when it comes to medicines, but I think that we will all agree that this must not be to the detriment of those who are dependent on access to cheap medicines.
eng	We must make every effort to improve efficiency and transparency and we must link this with an abandonment of unnecessary bureaucracy.
eng	We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country's laws has been committed.
eng	We need a European leadership to stand up against simplistic solutions - and I have heard some of them here today - and populism.
eng	We need research if we are to create jobs, and we need research, of course, to maintain employment in the EU and to remain competitive against the emerging economies.
eng	We need to find a solution which satisfies our expectations but also takes into account the specific situation of India.
eng	We need to realise that if we were to assume that cohesion policy is a policy only for the poorest, then it should slowly come to an end, which means it should slowly disappear completely from the

eng	Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the
eng	validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within
eng	weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well.
eng	What is more, better cooperation and coordination on development policy between Member States could save us EUR 6 billion.
eng	What message do you have to send to these people who are seeking, in a dignified and peaceful manner, prospects and a better future for themselves, their families and their children?
eng	What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union - thereby ensuring freedom of movement - and a debate

eng	When dealing with nuclear energy, safety and the transparency of procedures are two important issues which need to be constantly attended to. The answer is not necessarily to shut down plants, as

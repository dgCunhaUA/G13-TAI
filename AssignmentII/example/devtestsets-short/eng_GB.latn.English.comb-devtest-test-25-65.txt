eng	Firstly, we need to encourage the mobility and attractiveness of

eng	For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner
eng	Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a
eng	proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest
eng	warrants for minor offences.
eng	For the time being, the Commission has no plans to amend the

eng	Given the added value of Commission aid, and the Commission's
eng	new role in coordinating the Union's and the Member States'

eng	Given this and the importance of the office of President of the
eng	European Central Bank, I believe that Mr Draghi fulfils all the
eng	conditions to perform the mandate for which he has now been
eng	nominated with skill and dedication.
eng	Greening events dealing with the environment in Pillar 1 must be

eng	Having consulted with the political groups, I would like to
eng	submit to the House the following proposed amendments to the
eng	final version of the draft agenda:
eng	Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies
eng	in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are
eng	observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid
eng	judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a
eng	commendable plan. I hope that we will succeed in putting it into
eng	effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds.
eng	High unemployment among young people is one of the Commission's
eng	top priorities and is one of my foremost personal concerns.
eng	How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with
eng	third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are
eng	seeing us closing our countries' borders? Is it possible to talk
eng	about that? We cannot say ambiguous things.
eng	However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions
eng	are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies
eng	of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity,
eng	and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.
eng	However, I do not believe that the register's primary aim is
eng	solely to combat corruption as the instances of corruption have,
eng	however, been very few and far between.
eng	However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which
eng	substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal:
eng	safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause.
eng	However, and this concerns Mr Stavrakakis, there is also a need
eng	for improved cooperation with the other funds in this area and,
eng	in particular, the fund for rural development.
eng	However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve
eng	its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this
eng	regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact
eng	assessment is still in need of improvement.
eng	However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU,
eng	expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same
eng	time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against
eng	solidarity within the European Union because we will encourage
eng	internal divisions in the fight for funds, for example, in
eng	However, it is also absolutely our duty not to leave our
eng	producers high and dry when it is through no fault of their own
eng	that they have found themselves in this situation that threatens
eng	However, just as we remember the victims from the Baltic States,
eng	we also think of the Armenians, who were expelled from Turkey at
eng	the start of the last century.
eng	However, some western German regions require European aid, as do
eng	parts of the United Kingdom.
eng	However, the choice made today strengthens the cooperation
eng	between the two parties, and promotes a partnership capable of
eng	developing sustainable fishing and of exploiting the resources
eng	of Seychelles in a balanced way.
eng	However, the reality in this and in other sectors which have
eng	seen increased liberalisation, such as rail transport, belies
eng	these promises of benefits.
eng	However, there are very many domains which can contribute to
eng	synergies or economies of scale: the European External Action
eng	Service, humanitarian aid and civil protection, pooling of
eng	resources in defence, research and innovation, major
eng	infrastructure projects (especially in the areas of energy and
eng	However, this must not result in those countries and those
eng	farmers which already have very ambitious environmental
eng	programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by
eng	this new approach. A solution needs to be found here that is
eng	However, we came to the view that we needed to look a little
eng	more into what was behind this case.
eng	However, we will also need public participation across national
eng	Hungary, Latvia, Romania, outside the euro area, Ireland, Spain,
eng	Portugal, the United Kingdom and Greece too, apart from a break
eng	of four years, when our lot were in. In other words, your
eng	economic model does not work.
eng	I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning
eng	and activities that are not just for young people. I would
eng	definitely like to emphasise equal opportunities for all, not
eng	only in terms of gender equality, but also for disabled or
eng	otherwise disadvantaged people.
eng	I am concerned that the current budgetary constraints imposed on
eng	Member States may lead to greater restrictions on investment in
eng	research and innovation, with obvious negative effects on
eng	European growth and competitiveness. I therefore call on the
eng	Commission to consider leveraging the resources of the common
eng	strategic framework for funding these sectors, particularly the
eng	research and innovation sectors of the European Union.
eng	I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with
eng	promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary
eng	motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth.
eng	I am therefore in favour of the creation of additional
eng	indicators for measuring medium- and long-term social and
eng	economic progress, for example, indicators that take account of
eng	climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social
eng	I am voting for this report because it includes a range of
eng	concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of
eng	Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), by
eng	acknowledging the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP)
eng	and the need to include additional indicators to measure
eng	economic and social progress in the medium and long terms. I
eng	would also draw attention to the establishment of clear and
eng	measurable indicators that take into account climate change,
eng	biodiversity, efficient resource utilisation and social
eng	inclusion, which could help lead to a more inclusive society
eng	based on knowledge, and to lower carbon emissions.
eng	I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final
eng	resolution includes a clear call for full effective
eng	investigation into the European Union Member States' complicity
eng	and their renditions and secret detention programmes.
eng	I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national
eng	constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for
eng	political debate among European democracies.
eng	I congratulate my colleague Mr Pieper and all the rapporteurs
eng	for the excellent report that was presented.
eng	I endorsed adoption of the directive. I think the decision to
eng	extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in
eng	other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise,
eng	is more advisable than the previous version, which was
eng	restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure.
eng	I fully support Ms Pack's initiative and I want to ask
eng	Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include
eng	Sarajevo as a European cultural capital. I believe that, if we
eng	all want this, it absolutely can be possible, because it would
eng	be very disappointing if our ideas and common sense were to be
eng	I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy
eng	options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the
eng	innovative solution of an optional instrument, which means no
eng	harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of
eng	having a Europe-wide system. I have also seen the support for an
eng	instrument applicable in both B2C and B2B transactions, which
eng	favours a material scope covering sales contracts, contracts for
eng	the supply of digital content and some service contracts. I have
eng	taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament,
eng	namely, that any future instrument, whatever it looks like,
eng	should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to
eng	deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under
eng	I hope that this kind of problem, whereby the Council discharge
eng	has been postponed by Parliament, will never come up in the
eng	future again so I ask that even during the Hungarian Presidency
eng	we should have a political discussion and agreement.
eng	I particularly welcome the call for at least 70% of budget
eng	funding to be spent on territorial cooperation in cross-border
eng	collaboration, on the one hand, and for the funding for
eng	territorial cooperation to be increased from a level of 2.5% in
eng	the current programming period to at least 7% of total budget
eng	funding in the next programming period.
eng	I should like to express my pride at the European Parliament's
eng	broadly favourable view in support of the appointment of the new
eng	President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi.
eng	I support the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh
eng	Framework Programme of the European Union for research,
eng	technological development and demonstration activities because I
eng	believe that it truly reflects what has been achieved, as well
eng	I supported today's report calling for a joint register of
eng	lobbyists and interest groups to be set up. This is a first step
eng	towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and
eng	Commission. A 'transparency register' will improve ease of
eng	access for citizens wishing to find specific information
eng	regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with
eng	both MEPs and Commission officials.
eng	I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which
eng	represents a major step forward in consumer protection. I also
eng	welcome the option taken by the Council of restricting this
eng	directive to door-to-door and Internet sales - a market that is
eng	expanding significantly, but in which consumers still feel a
eng	little lost - and I approve of the simplification measures
eng	adopted, not least the possibility of consumers, but not
eng	companies, rescinding contracts by telephone.
eng	I think this resolution on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement
eng	I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of
eng	credit rating agencies as the standards may vary, and
eng	necessarily so, between Member States.
eng	I voted for the report because the transmission of pathogenic
eng	bacteria carrying AMR genes constitutes a particular threat to
eng	people, through the intake of said bacteria and/or through daily
eng	contact with animals. I believe that commitment to research is
eng	essential, as it contributes to the development of
eng	antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against
eng	diseases afflicting both people and animals.
eng	I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and
eng	creative industries should constitute an added value for the
eng	Union. A European statute for artists based on favourable
eng	working conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a
eng	dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work,
eng	making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals.
eng	I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the
eng	main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual
eng	Financial Framework. I should particularly like to emphasise the
eng	call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present
eng	proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural
eng	policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments
eng	between Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link
eng	between delivery of public goods to society and support payments
eng	to farmers. I fully support the call for the funds allocated to
eng	the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same
eng	level for the next financial programming period also, so that
eng	the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks.
eng	I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European
eng	Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the
eng	External Borders of the Member States of the European Union
eng	(Frontex) because, as the report states, its accounts and
eng	transactions, taken as a whole, are shown in the analysis to be
eng	positive, regular and legal.
eng	I voted in favour of the alternative motion for a resolution on
eng	corporate governance in financial institutions as it tables
eng	proposals which would ensure improvements in corporate
eng	governance structures throughout the EU, taking into account the
eng	fact that the financial sector must respond to the needs of the
eng	real economy, contribute to sustainable growth and demonstrate
eng	greater social responsibility.
eng	I voted in favour of the report on the Protocol extending to
eng	customs security measures the Agreement in the form of an
eng	Exchange of Letters between the European Economic Community and
eng	the Principality of Andorra, since it encourages trade between
eng	both parties while ensuring a high level of customs security and
eng	consistency between the agreement and the EU acquis.
eng	I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive
eng	80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws
eng	of the Member States relating to units of measurement and the
eng	repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC.
eng	I voted in favour of this report because I agree that
eng	demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working
eng	lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in
eng	lifelong learning have already become a necessity.
eng	I voted in favour of this report, but I think we should have
eng	been clearer and stronger in our demands when it comes to the
eng	mechanism of sanctions and penalties.
eng	I voted to give discharge to Frontex, but observe that the Court
eng	of Auditors reported, for the second year running, that the
eng	agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant
eng	decisions signed by the agency, while the rules in force make no
eng	provision for this type of instrument. I note that the amount
eng	paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009, and was EUR 17
eng	000 000 in 2008. I welcome, nevertheless, the agency's
eng	initiative, made in response to the Court's observation, of
eng	signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State
eng	I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed
eng	Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is
eng	something that we really should be looking at at European level
eng	because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many
eng	of the issues that we are facing.
eng	I welcome the Council's annual report and the efforts made to
eng	develop a European foreign policy. I consider it of the utmost
eng	importance to adopt a position which is harmonious with the
eng	Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead
eng	to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at
eng	I welcome the fact that Parliament is particularly pressing for
eng	agreements concluded by the European Union to include mutual
eng	recognition of aviation security and safety standards, as well
eng	as better safeguards for the protection of passenger rights.
eng	I welcomed this document because this report is a response to
eng	the Commission's Communication on the mid-term review of the
eng	autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
eng	(Galileo and EGNOS), which assesses the process and
eng	implementation so far and launches the debate on its future
eng	governance, exploitation and financing.
eng	I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more,
eng	when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the
eng	entire assessment process, to strive harder for its
eng	independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem
eng	in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a
eng	specific situation independently. I would also like to call for
eng	a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an
eng	extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals,
eng	including the possibility of submitting proposals in all
eng	official languages of the Union.
eng	I would like to ask what the position of the European Commission
eng	is regarding the restructuring of government debt.
eng	I would like to make five comments.
eng	I would like to urge the Commission to speed up the gathering of
eng	research from all Member States, but also to support new
eng	research into antibiotics that would be effective for humans and
eng	If Europe wants to successfully achieve the ambitious objectives
eng	of the Europe 2020 strategy, which place particular stress on
eng	innovation, research and training, it will have to invest in
eng	better qualified young people, opting for forms of education
eng	that are more geared towards future incorporation into the
eng	labour market and paying particular attention to knowledge that
eng	really prepares young people for the future.
eng	If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is
eng	to be ineffective - in other words, that refugees are not to be
eng	deported to their states of first arrival - then we must ask the
eng	Commission how committed it will be to taking action against
eng	those states that are obviously not currently implementing the
eng	If that is what we are being asked to think, it really is
eng	If the supply of energy resources is not exploited as a
eng	political tool, if it applies equal, transparent and
eng	non-discriminatory rules to all market players, if Russia makes
eng	an objective choice to make use of our existing mutual
eng	dependence in the field of energy in a collaborative way, based
eng	on specific, fair and legally binding principles, we shall be
eng	able to speak of a new era in the development of a united Europe.
eng	If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more
eng	than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are
eng	in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want
eng	to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help
eng	our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards
eng	democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and
eng	innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and
eng	investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still
eng	believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable
eng	development and solidarity between our countries, and if we
eng	still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport
eng	networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must
eng	call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
eng	If we fail - and I say we and I really mean us all - they will
eng	simply say that 'Europe' has failed.
eng	If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this
eng	naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national
eng	capitals here to Brussels.
eng	If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that
eng	the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally

eng	optimising the coordination of budgetary policies and
eng	strengthening the procedures for monitoring deficits and
eng	national debt are just some of the priorities to be pursued.

eng	In a speech on 7 April of this year, your colleague,
eng	Commissioner Potočnik, announced that, despite the Commission
eng	having avoided this issue and done nothing for many years, he
eng	intended presenting a communication in the autumn of this year
eng	in which he would tackle the problem, in particular with regard
eng	to implementation of existing regulations and an improved
eng	inspection system, as well as a broadening of the scientific
eng	In addition, I believe that if a Member State would like to
eng	extend the scope of application of European law to domestic
eng	transactions as well, it should be free to do so. It is very
eng	true to say that this is not the solution to every problem.
eng	In addition, the package we put forward last week urges rational
eng	reflection, taking into account short-term needs for
eng	strengthened external borders as well as a broader approach to
eng	In anticipation of the White Paper, the legislation now
eng	envisaged requires the Member States and the Commission to take
eng	the next steps towards a more sustainable and interoperational
eng	transport system, with a harmonised charging system
eng	internalising more external costs.
eng	In conclusion, therefore, I believe it is necessary that the
eng	2012 budget is able to respond to the challenges Europe is
eng	facing in a more concrete manner.
eng	In fact, Agriculture Ministers are holding an extraordinary
eng	Council meeting today to address E coli.
eng	In fact, the ability to recreate something offered to us and, on
eng	that basis, give rise to something new, is fundamental to the
eng	development of any economy and, above all, to achieving social
eng	In its initial assessment of the potential FTA between the EU
eng	and India, the Centre for the Analysis of Regional Integration
eng	at Sussex concluded that any gains would depend on the extent to
eng	which the text identified and dealt with the key areas which the
eng	Commissioner specifically mentioned, such as government
eng	procurement, services, investment in trade facilitation, etc.
eng	In my country's constitution, there is no mention of this issue,
eng	and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on
eng	the Italian constitution? Moreover, it is rather strange
eng	because, in my country, the only party that wants to change the
eng	constitution is Mr Berlusconi's centre-right party.
eng	In my opinion, the establishment of high quality international
eng	cooperation in the fight against the illegal drugs trade, not
eng	only at the European level but especially at the global level,
eng	would be one way to improve the effectiveness of the fight
eng	against this kind of trade.
eng	In my view, there will be no multiannual budgets from 2014
eng	onward so long as those declarations from Member States are not
eng	In order to avoid red tape and facilitate companies' access to
eng	European funding, simpler and more transparent procedures are
eng	In order to prevent this crisis becoming any worse, therefore,
eng	we need to take action regarding the fisheries sector's
eng	problems; swift and far-reaching action.
eng	In other words, with these problems of a railway alternative,
eng	the truth is that the agreement on the Eurovignette is now
eng	imposing even greater burdens on the transportation of products
eng	by road, which, in the peripheral countries, particularly in the
eng	south and in the east, are products of little or limited added
eng	In particular, efforts should be made to find a satisfactory
eng	solution to the problem of rules of origin so that products from
eng	other North American Free Trade Agreement members do not follow
eng	in the wake of Canadian products.
eng	In practical terms, the conclusions show that, while attention
eng	has been focused on improving long-term competitiveness, the
eng	objectives of improving the environment, enhancing quality of
eng	life and promoting coordination and communication have not been
eng	implemented strongly enough.
eng	In response to rumours about a cut in funding under the second
eng	pillar of the common agricultural policy, I repeat that I am in
eng	favour of guaranteeing adequate financial resources for rural
eng	In terms of horizontal agreements, it is also important to align
eng	existing bilateral agreements with EU law, so as to ensure
eng	greater legal certainty, increase transparency and provide
eng	additional benefits in terms of simplification, while ensuring
eng	that all Union airlines will enjoy the same rights.
eng	In the European Union, we also have countries that are facing
eng	the same kind of difficulties because of very high levels of

eng	initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be
eng	In the final analysis, irrespective of all the transparency
eng	achieved, it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member
eng	of this House, as this dictates what he thinks is right, whom he
eng	meets and whom he decides not to meet, whom he listens to and
eng	whom he decides not to listen to. After all, people also contact
eng	us using many other different communication channels.
eng	In the light of this, it is difficult to understand why the
eng	conservative, liberal and eurosceptic Members of this House have
eng	blindly attempted to toughen up the text proposed by the

eng	of Procedure, that he had received a letter from the National

eng	Court of Cassation and Justice of Romania) on 5 April 2011

eng	In the wake of the financial crisis and the ongoing need to
eng	reduce budget deficits across Europe, Parliament must recognise
eng	that the cohesion budget cannot continue to grow, unchecked.
eng	In this context, I would like particularly to refer to the
eng	debate on origin labelling for slaughter cattle which needs to
eng	be resolved, as well as tariff-related and technical obstacles,
eng	such as protracted approval procedures for EU products.
eng	In this regard, I confirm that I have authorised my staff to
eng	continue down our chosen path, because the Commission has always
eng	supported origin labelling both for products made in the
eng	European Union and for those that are imported.
eng	In this respect, I have to say that your refusal and that of the
eng	Council to allow the European Parliament to participate in
eng	establishing macroeconomic indicators through delegated acts
eng	does not seem to me to be the right approach.
eng	In this sense, the report suggests a single strategic framework
eng	for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European
eng	Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European
eng	Social Fund (ESF) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).
eng	Ensuring a common approach to these various regional funds will
eng	also serve to prevent overlapping and confusion for those
eng	economic operators at regional and local level who are

eng	introduced without penalties, and without restrictive penalties,
eng	In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism
eng	decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of
eng	setting out some general principles on how air agreements should
eng	be evaluated, covering both their substance and the procedures
eng	the Committee might adopt to ensure it is well informed
eng	throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to
eng	express its priorities well before being confronted with the
eng	yes/no choice of consent.
eng	Increasing the pace of research and innovation is crucial for
eng	introducing a fair and competitive economic model, ensuring jobs
eng	for the future, moving towards sustainable resource management,

eng	Indeed, my colleague, Mr Mann, referred to the visit there: the

eng	Indian railways - to give you an example, 17 000 trains
eng	transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans
eng	to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10
eng	years - are one of the many markets that could potentially be
eng	opened up with this free trade agreement.
eng	Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to
eng	get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to
eng	shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to
eng	International cooperation aimed at promoting these countries'
eng	self-sufficiency and independence is the right path towards
eng	achieving social and political peace at international level,
eng	which will not only fundamentally affect the beneficiary
eng	populations, but will also lead to the resolution of Europe's
eng	immigration problems. I therefore support increased European
eng	funding for this cause, as well as the creation of a financial
eng	instrument focused exclusively on it.
eng	Is it possible to abandon penalties, or is the penalty system a
eng	restrictive system? Fifteen years ago, when I was still a
eng	student, I learnt about the convergence criteria, and their
eng	It also costs our farmers a lot of money and dangerously
eng	undermines consumer confidence in our agricultural products and
eng	agri-food industry, which are still undoubtedly the safest and
eng	most strictly controlled in the world.
eng	It brings together in one policy cycle the two arms of economic
eng	recovery: financial stability that is based on fiscal
eng	consolidation, reflected in stability and convergence
eng	programmes, and structural reforms for a smart, sustainable,
eng	socially-inclusive and job-creating growth.
eng	It does not affect my colleagues in Ireland or ourselves at all
eng	because even though we are in the IMF - and we are broke as a
eng	country - we are well above the European average in GDP terms;
eng	so whether there is an intermediate category or not does not

eng	development in the Union, and a course of action that has great
eng	significance for the 27 Member States, which are required to lay
eng	down strategic territorial development guidelines through the
eng	increasingly active involvement of the social partners.
eng	It is about providing the transparency needed to know how Member
eng	States manage themselves, so that we may send them warning
eng	signals in time. I welcome the fact that the European Parliament
eng	followed this practice with close attention; in this European
eng	semester we encourage the Member States to maintain stricter
eng	budgetary management, and, at the same time, we lay down the
eng	basis for the practice of seeking growth in hard work and
eng	It is also important that in order to develop the linguistic
eng	competence of deaf children, they must first learn their mother
eng	tongue (sign language), which will allow them to become truly
eng	multilingual in the future.
eng	It is also, of course, partly because of the anticipated impact
eng	of the South Korean free trade agreement on Japanese exports,
eng	but I think that, in addition, it reflects recognition of
eng	Japan's limited experience with opening up.
eng	It is clear that dividing the competences of the committees
eng	creates some areas of overlap between which it is difficult to
eng	distinguish, so I believe that this clarification is a positive
eng	step and that the proposed new wording will enable greater
eng	consistency in using Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure.
eng	It is down to the EU to preserve its image by strengthening its
eng	commitment to ITER and demanding that its partners do the same.

eng	decimate extensive areas of forest annually in southern Europe,

eng	It is necessary to emphasise that GDP is a measure of production
eng	and does not reflect environmental sustainability, resource
eng	efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general.
eng	It is not only important for children, for the very young
eng	children I have been talking about and the young people that my
eng	colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for
eng	the future of Europe. I therefore strongly support what the
eng	Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to
eng	invest in education and should not be using the economic climate
eng	to make cuts, because making cuts in education would be the
eng	worse possible thing to do.
eng	It is obvious that today in Europe, even the biggest Member
eng	States do not have the necessary influence or leverage to talk
eng	on an equal basis with the United States or China and other
eng	powers, but together, the European Union can make a difference.
eng	It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for
eng	these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the
eng	present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU
eng	itself, to rate not only companies, but also the economies of

eng	It is therefore obvious that President Assad and his whole
eng	family need to be included on the list - not tomorrow, not the
eng	day after tomorrow, but today.
eng	It is true that the review aims to improve SMEs' access to
eng	financing, but it fails to mention social and environmental
eng	issues and does not even refer to the European Commission's plan
eng	for a Social Business Initiative, announced for the end of this
eng	It is very important, however, that continuity of service is
eng	guaranteed, as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS
eng	signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society,

eng	It is worth pointing out that the definition of domestic workers
eng	in the draft ILO Convention is very wide.
eng	It must be based on the road map agreed by the local players and
eng	must be endorsed by the SADC, the African Union and the
eng	It provides timely evidence of the progress in implementation
eng	throughout the EU-27 and promotes transparency of measures
eng	through integration with the Community's priorities.
eng	It should also be taken into account that non-recyclable nuclear
eng	waste must not be exported to third countries.
eng	It should introduce the financial tax and Eurobonds. I therefore
eng	voted for the Feio and Wortmann-Kool reports while I abstained
eng	on the Ferreira, Ford and Haglund reports and I voted for the
eng	Goulard report (for Eurobonds). A choice of votes that is
eng	intended to reflect my very mixed feelings over this package,
eng	which admittedly does offer some steps forward but which is
eng	still too poorly balanced: Europe will be unable to continue to
eng	develop without its people and therefore we must debate
eng	solutions for the future in public.
eng	It was also clear during the mission that we made to Bulgaria
eng	and Romania, and for this I would like to thank my fellow
eng	Romanian Members, Mr Marinescu, Mr Enciu and Mrs Weber, and my
eng	fellow Bulgarian Members, Mr Kovatchev and Mrs Nedelcheva.
eng	It will be a way for us to be able genuinely to exchange best
eng	practices. I believe that in the long term, this will constitute
eng	one firm basis for economic growth in Europe, but more important
eng	than economic growth is to remember that it is via this process
eng	that people, young people, can grow as individuals and Europeans.
eng	It would be appropriate that, in areas of exclusive competence,
eng	the EU should be the pre-eminent actor, with full membership,
eng	while the Member States might also - but not necessarily - be
eng	present as members, without, in most cases, an independent role.
eng	Its application must also guarantee environmental and social
eng	sustainability, and should not distort competition between

eng	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are

eng	Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Kirkhope this question
eng	because he agrees that the European Arrest Warrant needs review
eng	and re-evaluation - my view would be a lot stronger than that,
eng	Madam President, as I have already had the opportunity to state
eng	to both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food
eng	Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I
eng	cannot but express my disappointment at the failure of

eng	Madam President, the European Arrest Warrant has become one of
eng	the most successful instruments on mutual recognition adopted

eng	major question marks against the relevance and effectiveness of

eng	such as the omission of protection of gay people from
eng	discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers.
eng	Measures such as a European patent and the European professional

eng	to strengthen competitiveness and employment.
eng	Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the

eng	Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the
eng	European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity

eng	companies to public procurement outside the Union, in order to

eng	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a proper,
eng	reasonable offer by Parliament to the Commission and Council for
eng	the further development of the budgetary basis of the European
eng	Union in difficult times.
eng	Mr President, thank you for your kind words of solidarity.
eng	Mr President, the long-running military conflict between the
eng	government forces and the armed groups of the Liberation Tigers
eng	of Tamil Eelam, which has had very cruel consequences for the
eng	civilian population living in the conflict zones, came to an end
eng	Mr President, this week's European Council has a very
eng	Mr President, with regard to Camp Ashraf, we can do nothing less
eng	than join in the condemnation of the human rights violations
eng	that have taken place there.
eng	Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, it is simply not acceptable to spend
eng	your time permanently complaining and heckling and then, when
eng	you are called on to do something, to vote against better safety
eng	levels for nuclear power plants.
eng	My colleague Mr Eickhout has highlighted the numerous benefits
eng	to the EU of having more ambitious targets, and moves within
eng	this parliament to reduce our ambitions will be rejected by
eng	My personal view is that it is important, in this context, for
eng	us to convey a clear message to the European Union's other trade
eng	My vote in favour is based on the wisdom of this report, which
eng	not only embraces the innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon in
eng	matters of foreign policy and security, but also calls for
eng	greater coordination between the recently created European
eng	External Action Service, the Member States and the Commission.
eng	Nevertheless, I urge the Executive Director of the Agency to
eng	fully fulfil his obligation to include, in his report to the
eng	discharge authority summarising the Internal Audit Service (IAS)
eng	Report, all recommendations made (including the ones which could
eng	be possibly refused by the Agency) and all action taken on these
eng	recommendations; I call therefore on the Executive Director of
eng	the Agency to provide information on the content of the IAS's
eng	four 'very important' recommendations and the action taken by
eng	Nevertheless, we must make every effort to ensure that these
eng	policies promote the values and interests of the EU at
eng	international level, with the general aim of contributing to
eng	peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to
eng	the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights,
eng	to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support
eng	for international institutions, to effective multilateralism and
eng	mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to
eng	free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty.
eng	No, this is a proposal that the European Commission has made
eng	with respect to the massive flooding in Pakistan, time-bound for
eng	two years, with the possibility of its being continued for
eng	Not all MEPs are back in the Chamber after the fire drill.
eng	Now is perhaps the time, he said, for Plan B - something, I
eng	hasten to add, that the Committee on International Trade has
eng	been looking for for a long time.
eng	Now, in these turbulent times, a new competent Managing Director
eng	must therefore be appointed for an important global institution
eng	such as this and the process must be open.
eng	Of course I can understand that the increase in fuel prices
eng	could worsen the problem, but the main reason for the problem
eng	has always been overfishing - the fishing over the set limits
eng	which cannot leave stocks in a healthy state.
eng	Of course, there is a group of countries who are fiercely
eng	against it. This was also very visible here during the debate. I
eng	must just remind you that on 15 October, the Council agreed on
eng	the political compromise.
eng	On 14 April 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a
eng	decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation
eng	Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Belgium, with a view to
eng	supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers
eng	made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic
eng	On both sides, here it is not a matter of supplying arms, but
eng	rather of peaceful mediation between the two sides.
eng	On the contrary, until the spring events, Azerbaijan was making
eng	relatively good progress and was not listed by Human Rights
eng	Watch among such poorly-viewed states as China, Iraq, Israel,
eng	Russia, Saudi Arabia or Uzbekistan.
eng	On the other hand, I am convinced that the cooperation and
eng	verification mechanism - the famous CVM on which the Commission
eng	will release a report in July, dealing with the exact same
eng	issues that were voiced in this debate - could be helpful, even
eng	if officially, it is not part of the conditions for Schengen
eng	On the other hand, unilateral violation of the agreement must be
eng	prevented at all costs, since this threatens the construction of
eng	a European area without borders, which started in 1985.
eng	On top of this, they have an essential role in combating climate
eng	change due to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and
eng	One final question: tax evasion.
eng	One of the most controversial issues in this debate is whether
eng	or not to authorise the export of nuclear waste to countries
eng	outside the EU. I clearly supported the option of prohibiting
eng	exports to third countries, contrary to initial proposals. I
eng	also supported the proposal not to allow exports of waste other
eng	than for recycling, on the express condition that they should
eng	subsequently be imported back into the EU. This position was
eng	supported by a majority and I am glad of this.
eng	One was the speech by a Member from the United Kingdom of the
eng	Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe whose
eng	party is part of the coalition government in the UK. This party
eng	was opposed to nuclear power before the elections and supported
eng	it afterwards and this is the person who is criticising my
eng	thoroughness when it comes to the stress tests. I can only say
eng	that this speech would have been more appropriate at the party
eng	conference in London than it was here in Strasbourg.
eng	Operators often seek to benefit from inadequate inspections in
eng	order to get round the ban and smuggle the waste through other
eng	Member States where the inspections are less rigorous, as you
eng	Our cities are a central aspect of our key European objectives,
eng	although we must not ignore rural areas. I will never get tired
eng	of saying that if we are to improve energy efficiency we must
eng	Our primary objective must be to ensure high-quality and
eng	sustainable food production in Europe and for our rural areas to
eng	Overarching frequency planning and management at European level
eng	is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as
eng	the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out
eng	well and efficiently in the individual Member States. A
eng	coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however.
eng	Parliament has just given the Commission the green light to
eng	continue talks with the WTO but has insisted on restricting
eng	their duration and scope.
eng	Parliament was the first European institution to broach the
eng	subject of the increasing number of lobbies at European level,
eng	having launched the register for representatives of interest
eng	Parties should cooperate to establish an information-sharing
eng	mechanism, preferably coordinated by the Food and Agriculture
eng	Organisation (FAO), in conjunction with other relevant
eng	multilateral and intergovernmental initiatives, and to
eng	facilitate the exchange of information with existing databases
eng	relevant to the agreement.
eng	Perhaps, the Commissioner could explain once again when the
eng	Office will actually be up and running.
eng	Poor economic statistics could be one of the reasons for the
eng	Preventive actions are crucial in this respect, as they allow
eng	for situations to be prevented without ex post actions having to
eng	be taken. I agree with the report when it supports the
eng	Commission's approach and extends the use of reversed qualified
eng	majority voting to block a Commission decision in the Council.
eng	Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral
eng	part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU's functioning.
eng	Rather, it is proof of the complex situation in Egypt. I
eng	therefore believe that close monitoring by the European
eng	Parliament - especially through Commissioner Ashton's statement
eng	- is absolutely necessary.
eng	Regarding the Southern Neighbourhood: the European Council is
eng	expected to endorse the new approach to relations with the EU
eng	neighbours which was agreed at Monday's Foreign Affairs Council.
eng	Reinforced economic governance in Europe is simply too important
eng	to fail on this final remaining issue.
eng	Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the
eng	principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social
eng	dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on
eng	these occasions. I believe that the report we have adopted
eng	offers sound backing for these objectives.
eng	Russia is one of Europe's most important economic partners, not
eng	to mention a neighbouring country on which, inter alia, European
eng	Second: the European Union will impress upon Russia that more
eng	progress needs to be made on agreeing substantial trade and
eng	investment provisions, including on energy, in the new EU-Russia
eng	Agreement in order to provide a solid legal basis for deepened
eng	economic cooperation in the years to come.
eng	Secondly, in the light of the call in the report for steps to
eng	remove barriers to mobility, I would highlight the fact that a
eng	Council recommendation designed to encourage Member States to do
eng	precisely this is due to be adopted by the Council in the coming
eng	Secondly, the role of the Commission, as highlighted by the
eng	Commissioner, is praiseworthy; and, thirdly, the point made by
eng	Paul Rübig that a new regulator should oversee the stress tests
eng	and any future power plants that are built would be very
eng	Serving the harmonious development of the EU is one of the
eng	objectives of cohesion policy, which is an indispensable
eng	instrument for reinforcing the economic, social and territorial
eng	reality of Europe, as well as an essential factor for the
eng	realisation of smart and inclusive growth as anticipated in the
eng	Europe 2020 strategy. I support this report as I feel that
eng	territorial cohesion should be adequately supported through the
eng	allocation of greater structural funds, and it is therefore
eng	right that the share allocated to Objective 3 be increased from
eng	the current 2.5% to 7%, considering in addition that around
eng	37.5% of the European population lives in border regions.
eng	Should we not draw lessons from what is happening in what are
eng	called the Arab countries and not demand of our Eastern partners
eng	what we did not demand of some governments, notably those of
eng	Tunisia, Libya or Egypt? Should we not, Mr Andor, see to it that
eng	democracy can finally rule in those countries, that we have
eng	minimum requirements in the matter?
eng	Since consultations on the horizontal proposal concerning the
eng	country of origin in trade policy have not ended yet, it did not
eng	seem appropriate for us to create a precedent that would
eng	jeopardize the proposal and prejudice the outcome of that debate.
eng	Since these practices are carried on across frontiers, it is
eng	very difficult to bring those responsible to justice.
eng	So I would like to thank everybody for this useful debate once
eng	again, it is good that now we have a schedule concerning the
eng	future as well, and it is very important for us that, as several
eng	Members have indicated, we can combat counterfeiting as
eng	efficiently as possible and that the European consumer can trust
eng	the traceability of textile products.
eng	So this is a first data point for evaluation, provided that we
eng	agree that the target of the programmes is to overcome the
eng	budgetary and economic crisis and not to create a culture of
eng	punishment leading to euro-scepticism in Europe.
eng	So, integrating training and education, infrastructure around
eng	housing programmes, opportunities for small businesses to grow,
eng	working with UN women - as I am - to consider how we build safer
eng	communities around the housing projects, how we work together to
eng	design a much bigger, grander vision that is built upon what the
eng	Egyptian people want. I am talking to the Foreign Minister of
eng	Egypt, Al-Araby, who is committed to working closely with us on
eng	the Middle East Peace Process, keen to develop the strength of
eng	the relationship that we already have, and keen to see us as
eng	partners in collaborating in the region.
eng	Some members of the currency union are paying for the
eng	irresponsibility or adventurism of others, and a move towards
eng	greater transparency and clearer budgetary rules leading to the
eng	avoidance of long-term problems in our countries has therefore
eng	South Sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable
eng	Stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of
eng	religious affiliations are considered offences in France and
eng	this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto.
eng	Such action should include brokering an agreement between
eng	Rajoelina and Ravalomanana, allowing the former president to
eng	return to Madagascar without any risk or prejudice.
eng	Surely we are not going to allow the will of two Heads of State
eng	to jeopardise one of Europe's greatest achievements.
eng	Temporary emergency measures are needed that will enable
eng	European fishers to overcome their difficult economic situation,
eng	but the Commission should also draw up a medium- and long-term
eng	plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries sector,
eng	Thanks to these and strict adherence to the rules established by
eng	the new Stability and Growth Pact, I am sure that the EU will
eng	gain in strength and will be able to face new challenges without
eng	assistance policies and, worse still, outdated slogans that lead
eng	nowhere and do only damage, especially among the weakest members
eng	That is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning
eng	mechanism to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances, in
eng	order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen, for instance
eng	in Ireland or the credit boom we have seen in Spain.
eng	That is the core of the problem, and now we are living out the
eng	consequences and we are at a turning point.
eng	That is why I agree with the rapporteur that it is time to act
eng	now and to see what positive action we can take.
eng	That is why it is so important to promote freedom of movement
eng	for workers within the Union.
eng	That is why we in the Group of the Greens want the EU2020
eng	objectives to be fully binding in the Stability and Growth Pact
eng	and in the reports, and also the deficit and debt objectives.
eng	That really is my huge topic right now, so I urge the
eng	Commissioner to please keep on track and focus also on the
eng	future, to create something like a statute for internships which
eng	establishes rules against exploitation ...
eng	That, of course, includes access to social security, health and
eng	safety protection and maternity protection, as well as
eng	provisions on working and rest time.
eng	The Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
eng	Applications outlines the steps that are essential to the GNSS
eng	passing a turning point and guaranteeing project success.
eng	The CETA will also cover regulatory barriers such as sanitary
eng	and phytosanitary measures, customs procedures and competition
eng	The Commission for Petitions regrets the fact that Directive
eng	2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which is
eng	applicable to business-to-business transactions, seems either to
eng	fall short of providing effective counter-measures or to be
eng	insufficiently implemented by Member States.
eng	The Commission is analysing the results of the public
eng	consultation and then it will prepare a detailed impact
eng	assessment to see what should be the next step that, in times of
eng	crisis, will be good for giving a boost to the Internal Market
eng	and creating growth and jobs in the Internal Market by expanding
eng	the markets, mostly for SMEs, and giving consumers the
eng	possibility of better choice and better deals.
eng	The Commission must therefore put pressure on the Member States
eng	to persuade them to assume responsibility for the funds that the
eng	EU allows them to manage.
eng	The Commission therefore very much appreciates Parliament's
eng	approach, focusing on the long-term benefit of investing in

eng	panic and, as a result, we are mourning lives, we are mourning

eng	Left agrees with the general parts of the resolution, but has
eng	serious doubts over the points specifically mentioned, and

eng	The Council should also participate in the common register,
eng	which should be made mandatory and serve as a dynamic instrument
eng	in guaranteeing the transparency of the decision-making process.
eng	The Digital Agenda and the digital economy represent one of the
eng	most important objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, aimed at
eng	closing the digital gap, and increasing the productivity,
eng	cohesion and competitiveness of European industry, and ensuring
eng	better access to the single market for the EU's consumers and
eng	The EU cannot forget its role in every respect as a leading
eng	actor on the world stage.
eng	The EU is an ageing society, and therefore the influx of
eng	migrants should not be regarded only as a threat to European
eng	The EU should support the initiatives of young and talented
eng	people to promote particular political strategies. A good
eng	example of such activity is the website Eastbook.eu, whose
eng	founders supply thousands of Internet users every day with
eng	information about events in the countries of the Eastern
eng	Partnership and the progress of the programme.
eng	The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are
eng	clear and its objectives are measurable.
eng	The European Commission worked around the clock to be able to
eng	issue a positive report on 10 June. I can assure you that both
eng	the Croatians and the Hungarian Presidency have been working day
eng	and night to make this happen.
eng	The European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission,

eng	phenomenon of an increasing number of interest groups at

eng	The Structural Funds are one of the main tools for implementing
eng	the economic and social policy of the Union.
eng	The UN's Darusman report, which is the immediate pretext for
eng	this debate, states clearly that in those final stages, the LTTE
eng	used the civilian population as human shields, intensified the
eng	forcible recruitment of civilians, including children, into its
eng	ranks, executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict

eng	course, in many fields, there are qualitatively highly differing
eng	methods of education and training.
eng	The changes made to the common agricultural policy will
eng	therefore not be merely qualitative - improving the targeting of
eng	our objectives - they will also aim to distribute payments among

eng	package of measures that the European Commission has tabled on
eng	economic governance. I am voting for the Ford report on
eng	requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States. I
eng	welcome the fact that the regulation will be applicable to all
eng	EU Member States. I would stress the need for means of
eng	independent oversight to be established. I welcome the

eng	There is no doubt that the scale of the economic meltdown in
eng	Greece, coupled with the risk of a similar crisis hitting many
eng	other Member States, urgently requires a strategy to prevent
eng	such a disaster from happening again.
eng	There is precious little time and there is a heavy
eng	responsibility on the European Commission, and certainly more
eng	now on the Member States, who are weakening and backing off from
eng	what they promised initially after what happened in Japan.

eng	offence under the extraditing country's laws has been committed.
eng	We need a European leadership to stand up against simplistic
eng	solutions - and I have heard some of them here today - and
eng	We need research if we are to create jobs, and we need research,
eng	of course, to maintain employment in the EU and to remain
eng	competitive against the emerging economies.
eng	We need to find a solution which satisfies our expectations but
eng	also takes into account the specific situation of India.
eng	We need to realise that if we were to assume that cohesion
eng	policy is a policy only for the poorest, then it should slowly
eng	come to an end, which means it should slowly disappear
eng	completely from the list of European policies.
eng	We now have a package before us. We have achieved a great deal.
eng	We rely on the European Commission to achieve that and the
eng	European Parliament will be behind the Commission in
eng	strengthening Schengen, but if there are two lessons that we

eng	budget for the coming years. I await with curiosity the
eng	Commission's answer to a number of comments made by Mr Bart
eng	Staes in his excellent report.
eng	We trust that the European Parliament's message will act as a
eng	guide and that unanimity will be achieved in the Council so that

eng	What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex

eng	dealing with this form of energy and the waste it produces.
eng	When properly shaped in the budget, they could create room for

eng	With a view to overcoming the economic and financial crisis,
eng	public procurement appears to be a catalyst for the
eng	revitalisation of the European economy, and of enterprise,
eng	employment and consumer welfare in Europe.
eng	With regard to surveillance missions, I have serious
eng	reservations concerning the proposal for such missions, since
eng	they will be composed mainly of European Commission officials
eng	and will have significant powers entrusted to them, without the

eng	Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,
eng	but who is able to stand before jealousy?
eng	Like water reflects a face,
eng	Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;
eng	A stingy man hurries after riches,

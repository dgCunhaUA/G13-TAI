eng	Union, such as Ireland, as centrally located Member States have the option of switching to rail.
eng	The refugee problem cannot be automatically resolved by returning to a regime of border controls.
eng	The report also fails to mention the withdrawal of sovereign debt from the agencies' ratings, which is the main measure
eng	The report calls for the strengthening of basic employment standards, which are enshrined in the conventions of the
eng	International Labour Organisation, including freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of
